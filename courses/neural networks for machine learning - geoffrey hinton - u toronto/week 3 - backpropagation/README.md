## 3a - Linear Neuron Weight Learning

### Perceptron Learning Does Not Work For Hidden Layers

* every step, weights use averaging to get closer to "generously feasible" ideal weightings
* networks where avg of two good solutions is a worse solution exist
* "multi-layer" NNs don't use perceptron 

## 3b - Linear Neuron Error Surface

## 3c - Logistic Output Neuron Weight Learning

## 3d - Backpropagation Algorithm

## 3e - Using Backpropagation Algorithm Derivatives
