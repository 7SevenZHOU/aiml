## 3a - Linear Neuron Weight Learning

### 3a Intro - Why Not Perceptron?

* every step, weights use averaging to get closer to "generously feasible" good weights; weights always get closer to good set of weights
* but in some networks, an average of two good solutions is a worse solution
* \(as a result?\) "multi-layer" NNs don't use perceptron

* Alternative approach: get output values to move closer to target

  * works for non-convex problems
  * where there exists several independent sets of good weights
  * where averaging good weights may give bad set of weight

* Simplest example: linear neuron with squared error

### 3a Intro - Linear Neurons

### ![](/assets/linear-neurons-def1.png) {#linear-neuron-def1}

* also called _Linear Filters_

* error: squared difference between target and produced output

  * different from perceptron because error there was for weights

* we'll take iterative method rather than solving using calculus because it's easier to generalize to n leveled problems and because it's probably  more like how it happens biologically

### 3a Example - Fish, Chips Ketchup

* Fish, chips, ketchup. Every day you order relatively random amounts for lunch and find out total price at end.

* Eventually, you will figure out  price of fish, chips, ketchup individually by knowing how much of each you ordered and the  amount that the total changed.

* You order \(2, 5, 3\) for \(fish, chips, ketchup\), which costs 850, the target. The correct prices are \(150, 50, 100\), but you don't know that.

* First, you guess \(50, 50, 50\) for the prices / weights. This would give a total of \(50, 50, 50\) \* \(2, 5, 3\) = 500. This means that the _residual error_ is 800 - 500 = 350.

* _Delta rule_ for learning prices / weights is $$\Delta w_i = \varepsilon x_i(t-y)$$, where i is the index of the lunch ingredient, $$\varepsilon$$ is the learning rate of 1/35 \(chosen by you\), $$x_i$$ is the count of the number of the $$i$$th things you order, $$t$$ is the target price of the entire meal, and $$y$$ is the output generated in this iteration of the model given by \(50, 50, 50\) here.

* This gives new weights of \(1/35\)\(2, 5, 3\)\(50, 50, 50\)\(350\) = 10\*\(2, 5, 3\)\(50, 50, 50\) = \(70, 100, 80\)

  * weight for chips got worse - this is different than perceptron

### 3a Iterative Learning Procedure - Behavior

* There may not be a perfect solution.
* By making learning rate small, we can get closer to good enough solution. 
* If all dimensions are highly correlated, it will take much longer. 
* vs. Perceptrons
  * in perceptrons, we change the weight vector by input vector _only when an error of a certain size is made \(&gt;= generously feasible\)_
  * in _online_ version of delta-rule, we continually change weight vector by _error scaled by learning rate_. 

## 3b - Linear Neuron Error Surface

Visualizing simple linear network error surface:

![](/assets/error-surface-linear-neuron.png)

* horizontal axis for _each_ weight \(why not?\)
* vertical error axis
* plotting horizontal axis against vertical axis makes a bowl
* plotting weights against each other makes elliptical contours; inner ellipse is at bottom of error bowl

For multi-layer, non-linear nets the error surface is more complicated than this single bowl.

### 3b question

* Suppose we have a dataset of two training points.

  $$\begin{align*} x_1 &= (1, -1) & t_1&=0 \\ x_2 &= (0, 1) & t_2&=1 \end{align*}$$

* Consider a network with two input units connected to a linear neuron with weights $$w=(w_1, w_2)$$. What is the equation for the error surface when using a squared error loss function?

* Hint: The squared error is defined as $$\frac{1}{2}(w^T x_1 - t_1)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(w^T x_2 - t_2)^2$$

  * A: $$E = \frac{1}{2}\left(w_1^2 + 2w_2^2 - 2w_1w_2 -2w_2 + 1\right)$$

  * B: $$E = \frac{1}{2}\left((w_1 - w_2 - 1)^2 + w_2^2\right)$$

  * C: $$E = \frac{1}{2}\left(w_1^2 - 2w_2^2 + 2w_1w_2 + 1\right)$$

  * D: $$E = \frac{1}{2}(w_1 - w_2)^2$$

* First guess:

  * Squared error loss function is the type applicable to the error surface just described.

  * Here, we're given two data points and we have to pick the equation of the error surface given the relationship between them.

  * 0.5\(\(w1, w2\)\(1, -1\) - 0\)^2 + 0.5\(\(w1, w2\)\(0, 1\) -1\)^2

  * 0.5\(1w1, -1w2\)^2 + 0.5\(0w1-1, 1w2-1\)^2

  * 0.5\(w1^2, w2^2\) + 0.5\(-1^2, \(w2-1\)^2\)

  * 0.5\(w1^2, w2^2\) + 0.5\(1, w2^2 - 2w2 + 1\)

  * 0.5\(w1^2+1, 2w2^2 - 2w2 + 1\)

  * My vector arithmetic is rusty, but I don't understand how you can use the squared error equation to arrive at a scalar

  * If one were able to add the two vector components, it would be: 0.5\(w1^2 + 2w2^2 - 2w2 + 2\), which is very close to answer A

* Correct Answer: A

  > The error summed over all training cases is  
  > $$E = \frac{1}{2}(w_1  -w_2 - 0)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(0w_1 + w_2 - 1)^2 = \frac{1}{2}\left(w_1^2 + 2w_2^2 - 2w_1w_2 -2w_2 + 1\right)$$
  >
  > Note the quadratic form of the energy surface. For any fixed value of E, the contours will be ellipses. For fixed values of w1, it's a parabolic relation between E and w2. Similarly for fixed values of w2."

* Somehow, you are able to just add w1 to w2 to arrive at E

* I made a mistake between step 1 and step 2 when I moved -1 inside the parens on the right - I duplicated the -1, which is why I ended up with +2 instead of +1 `#offByOneError`

### 3b - Online vs Batch Learning

Simplest _batch learning_ - do _steepest descent_, traveling perpendicular to the contour lines to the bottom of the bowl. "We get the gradient, summed over all training cases."

Simplest _online learning_ - zig-zag around direction of steepest descent:![](/assets/linear-neuron-online-zigzag-constraints.png)

* _online learning_ - after each training case, change the weights in proportion to the error gradient for that single training case
* The change in the weights moves us towards a constraint plane. In picture above, there are two training cases: each of the blue lines. Training case one is at upper right.
* Start at outer red dot and compute the gradient on first training case using delta rule. This moves us perpendicularly towards the first constraint plane. 
* If we alternate between the training cases, we'll zigzag backwards and forwards between the two constraint planes until we intersect.

#### Learning Speed

* If picking a random starting point, it's ideal if the error space cross sections are more like circles than elongated ellipse. 
* If cross sections are circular, then the chances of picking a bad starting point are lower.
* If cross sections are elongated ellipses, it's possible for the direction to a constraint to lead away from the bottom of the error surface.
  * This happens when lines that correspond to training cases are almost parallel
  * "Nasty property" - gradient is big in direction we do not want to learn, and small in the direction we do want to learn, which is the bottom of the error bowl
  * The way I picture this is to review the unit circle and the graph of $$tan(\theta)$$
  * Here is [a Kahn Academy link to that](https://youtu.be/FK6-tZ5D7xM?t=387).
  * If the angle/slope between the two training cases is parallel, the amount of incorrect descent goes to infinity
  * If the angle/slope between the two training cases is perpendicular, the amount of incorrect descent is zero. This only happens when the error contours are circular.

#### Learning Speed Question:

_If our initial weight vector is _$$(w_1, 0)$$_ for some real number _$$w_1$$_, then on which of the following error surfaces can we expect steepest descent to converge poorly? Check all that apply._

| A: ![](/assets/error_surface_bad1.png) | B: ![](/assets/error_surface_nice.png) |
| :--- | :--- |
| C: ![](/assets/error_surface_nice2.png) | D: ![](/assets/error_surface_bad2.png) |

I guessed that A and D would converge poorly, since they were elongated ellipticals.

I do not know what the significance of the axis is or what the position of the gradient in the axis represents.

After submitting, I see that A was a correct answer but D was marked as incorrect.

The explanation for A is:

> _The first one is similar to the picture shown in the lectures. It is a diagonally oriented ellipse and steepest descent will still tend to zig-zag on this error surface. Even though the second and third **have different minima locations** and scalings, the steepest descent direction will still take you very close to the minimum with the appropriate learning rate. The last case is tricky: even though the shape is an ellipse, the **initial weight vector starts off somewhere along the x axis**, and so again the steepest descent direction points directly toward the minimum. In other words, **there is zero gradient along the vertical axis** and therefore we are simply minimizing a parabola along one dimension from that point to get to the minimum._

There are several things that I am lost on here:

* What are the "different minima locations" referred to in B and C?  
* When discussing D, he says "the initial weight vector starts somewhere along the x axis." Where is the initial weight vector? 
  * Going back to the problem statement, it is \(w1, 0\), so we know that w2 is zero in the initial point.
* I assume that the shape of the ellipse comes from two training cases, as in the lectures.

## 3c - Logistic Output Neuron Weight Learning

![](/assets/logistic-neuron-def1.png)Logistic neurons have an output that is a monotonically increasing function of its input. The output of the neuron is \(0, 1\) on \(-inf, inf\). Once the sum of the weights multiplied by the inputs approaches a certain threshold, the neuron's output continuously and quickly changes from zero to one.

The neuron's output is a function of the _logit z_, which is the biased sum of the product of the wights and inputs. The output y = 1/\(1 + e^-z\).

### Logistic Neuron Derivatives

Derivatives of the logit z with respect to the inputs and weights are simple: dz/dw\__i = x\_i; dz/dx\_i = w\_i. _

The derivative of whole logistic neuron w.r.t. the logit is simple: $$dy/dz=y(1-y)$$. The reason why:

$$y=\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}=(1+e^{-z})^{-1}$$ by definition of negative power. So using the [power rule](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/basic-differentiation-ab/power-rule-ab/v/power-rule), $$\frac{dy}{dz}=-1(1+e^{-z})^{-2}=-1(1+\frac{1}{(1+e^{-z})^{2}})=\frac{-1e^{-z}}{(1+e^{-z})^{2}}-1$$. Using fraction addition, we end up with:

$$\frac{dy}{dz}=\frac{-1(-e^{-z})}{(1+e^{-z})^{2}}=(\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}})(\frac{e^{-z}}{1+e^{-z}})=y(1-y)$$

because $$\frac{e^{-z}}{1+e^{-z}}=\frac{(1+e^{-z})-1}{1+e^{-z}}=\frac{(1+e^{-z})}{1+e^{-z}}\frac{-1}{1+e^{-z}}=1-y$$

#### Learn Weights Using Chain Rule

* To learn the weights, we need derivative of output w.r.t. each weight:
  * $$\frac{\delta y}{\delta w_i}=\frac{\delta z}{\delta w_i}\frac{dy}{dz}=x_iy(1-y)$$, multiplying the derivative with respect to z by the derivative with respect to the ith weight, which is just x\_i
  * The derivative of the total error with respect to an individual weight,$$\frac{\delta E}{\delta w_i}$$ is equal to the sum of the derivatives of the outputs on the nth neuron w.r.t. its ith input multiplied by the derivative of the total error by the output of the nth neuron: 
  * $$ \sum_n \frac{\delta y^{n}}{\delta w_i}\frac{\delta E}{\delta y^{n}} $$, which is equal to the negative sum of \(x\)\(y\(1-y\)\)\(t-y\), 
    * _x_ refers to the \_i\_th input of the \_n\_th neuron 
    * _y_ refers to the output of the \_n\_th neuron
    * _t_ refers to the target output of the \_n\_th neuron
    * x\(t-y\) is the delta rule and y\(1-y\) is the extra term, which represents the slope of the logistic
    * question: _why the negative sum_?

## 3d - Backpropagation Algorithm

* convert diff between output and target output into an error derivative
* then compute error derivatives in each hidden layer from layer above
* use error derivatives w.r.t "activities" to get error derivatives w.r.t. incoming weights
  * Hinton uses the word "activities" without defining it, and I'm not sure what he means
  * It uses it only after referencing an inefficient darwinian algorithm that has to do with random perturbations of weights, so one could infer that by "activities" he means varying weights in hidden layers, but it's not clear
  * 

## 3e - Using Backpropagation Algorithm Derivatives

### Converting error derivatives into a learning procedure

* Backpropagation is efficient algorithm for computing $$\frac{\delta E}{\delta w}$$ for _every_ weight on a _single_ training case. 

To get to learning procedure, we need to overcome

* **optimization issues**: how to use error derivatives to discover a good set of weights
* **generalization issues**: how to ensure that learned weights work well for cases we did not see during training

### Optimization Issues

* _how often_ to update the weights
  * **online** means after each training case, as though you were downloading each training case "in real time"
  * **full batch** means after a full sweep through training data
  * **mini batch** means after a small sample of training cases

_how much_ to update weights \(discussed later in lecture 6\)

* fixed learning rate?
* adapt global learning rate?
* adapt learning rate on each connection?
* do _not_ use steepest descent?

### Overfitting

* training data contains noise
  * **unreliable target values**, happen if the judgment of the entity that coded the target values doesn't have 100% of your confidence
  * there is **sampling error**: accidental regularities just because of the particular training cases chosen
* when fitting model, it cannot tell which regularities are real and which are caused by sampling error
  * both of these get "fitted upon" just as if they were intentional, useful data
  * If model is very flexible there is a danger that it can model the sampling error really well, which can be _a disaster_ \(Hinton's words\)![](/assets/overfitting-example.png)
  * which model do you trust? 
    * complicated model fits data better but it is not 
    * _A model_ is convincing when it fits a lot of data surprisingly well.
    * It is not surprising that a complicated model can fit a small amount of data well.

### Reducing Overfitting

Will be discussed more in lecture 7

* Weight-decay
* Weight-sharing
* Early stopping
* Model averaging
* Bayesian fitting of neural nets
* Dropout
* Generative pre-training

## 3f - Lecture 3 Quiz

### q1

Which of the following neural networks are examples of a feed-forward network?

| **A**![](/assets/backprop3.png) | B ![](/assets/backprop6.png) |
| :--- | :--- |
| C ![](/assets/backprop1.png) | D ![](/assets/backprop4.png) |

I chose A and C because they are tiered and flow up without cycles. B and D have cycles.

### q2

Consider a neural network with only one training case with input $$\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)^\top$$ and correct output $$t$$. There is only one output neuron, which is logistic, i.e. $$y = \sigma(\mathbf{w}^\top\mathbf{x})$$ \(notice that there are no biases\). The loss function is squared error. The network has no hidden units, so the inputs are directly connected to the output neuron with weights $$\mathbf{w} = (w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n)^\top$$. We're in the process of training the neural network with backpropagation algorithm. What will the algorithm add to $$w_i$$for the next iteration if we use a step size \(also known as a learning rate\) of $$\epsilon$$? \[multiple choice\]

* A: $$\epsilon(t - y)y(1-y)x_i$$
* B: $$\epsilon(t - y)y(1-y)w_ix_i$$
* C: $$\epsilon(t - y)x_i$$
* D: $$\epsilon(y- t)y(1-y)w_ix_i$$

#### q2 - work

We  have one neuron and no hidden units. We're going to use the method of learning the weights of a logistic unit: the negative of sum of the partial derivatives of the output with respect to the weights times the partial derivative of the error $$E$$ w.r.t. the output. This is the delta rule times the slope of the logistic.

The delta rule for learning with a linear neuron was originally $$\Delta w_i=\epsilon x_i(t-y)$$. The question is, what do we use for a logistic neuron? The slope of the logistic or the derivative of the neuron output w.r.t. the logit is $$y^{n}(1-y^{n})$$.

The _batch_ delta rule for a linear neuron changes weights in proportion to their error derivatives _summed over all training cases_:

$$\Delta w_i=-\epsilon \frac{\delta E}{\delta w_i}=\sum_n \epsilon x_i^{n}(t^{n}-y^{n})$$

We're not doing batch learning since we're doing one iteration.

I'm going to choose A, as that has the most similarity to the equation where we found the derivative of E w.r.t. w\_i for a logistic unit. That was before we used backpropagation, though, so I am not sure what to make of the statement that we're in the process of training the neural network with the backpropagation algorithm. I think really, we just need to find the weights at the top level before backpropagation makes sense, and A is the one that makes the most sense.

I'm not going to select any others, as I think it is a mistake that it is multiple choice.

### q3

Suppose we have a set of examples and Brian comes in and duplicates every example, then randomly reorders the examples. We now have twice as many examples, but no more information about the problem than we had before. If we do not remove the duplicate entries, which one of the following methods will _not_ be affected by this change, in terms of the computer time \(time in seconds, for example\) it takes to come close to convergence? \[Multiple Choice\]

1. Full-batch learning
2. Mini-batch learning, where for every iteration we randomly pick 100 training cases
3. Online learning, where for every iteration we randomly pick a training case

#### q3 - work

Full batch learning will be slower, since the data set will be bigger.

Mini-batch learning will be a bit slower, since the information will be more diluted, but the situation is not as bad as it would be if Brian had duplicated them 500 times.

I believe that online learning will likely converge a bit slower as well, since the chance of getting the same data point twice is increased.

I'm not going to select any of the options.

### q4

Consider a linear output unit versus a logistic output unit for a feed-forward network with \_no hidden layer \_shown below. The network has a set of inputs x and an output neuron y connected to the input by weights w and bias b.

![](/assets/w3qp4.png)

We're using the squared error cost function even though the task that we care about, in the end, is binary classification. At training time, the target output values are 1 \(for one class\) and 0 \(for the other class\). At test time we will use the classifier to make decisions in the standard way: the class of an input x according to our model after training is as follows:

$$\text{class of }x=\begin{cases} 1 \text{ if } w^Tx + b \geq 0 \\ 0 \text{ otherwise} \end{cases}$$

Note that we will be training the network using, but that the decision rule shown above will be the same at test time, regardless of the type of output neuron we use for training.

Which of the following statements is true?

1. Unlike a logistic unit, using a linear unit will penalize us for getting the answer right too confidently.

2. The error function \(the error as a function of the weights\) for both types of units will form a quadratic bowl.

3. At the solution that minimizes the error, the learned weights are always the same for both types of units; they only differ in how they get to this solution.

4. For a logistic unit, the derivatives of the error function with respect to the weights can have unbounded magnitude, while for a linear unit they will have bounded magnitude.

#### 4 - Work
