## 4c - The Softmax Output Function

Squared error cost function has drawbacks:

* There is almost no gradient if desired output is 1 and actual output is 0.00000001
* If we are trying to pick between mutually exclusive classes and we know probabilities should sum to one, no way to encode that

Softmax is a cost function that is an alternative to squared error

It is applied to a group of neurons called _a softmax group_

Inputs to neurons in a softmax group are called _logits_

In the group, the outputs all sum to one

Outputs given by:

$$y_i = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j \in group} e^{z_j}}$$

Output Derivatives:

$$\frac{\delta y_i}{\delta z_i}=y_i(1-y_i)$$

This is not trivial to derive.
